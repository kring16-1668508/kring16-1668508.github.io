		<p class=ex2>Kanye West is a producer-turned-rapper who has reinvented hip hop. Although he is a creative genius, it is sometimes overcasted by his craziness. He has made headlines for bizarre tweets and his huge pronouncements, award-show stage invasions, and his marriage with reality TV star Kim Kardashian. Six of his seven solo albums have been at the No. 1 spot, 34 million albums sold, 21 Grammy awards, and two inclusions in Time magazine's 100 most influential people list.</p>
